# Utils Directory Guide

The [lib/utils/](mdc:lib/utils) directory contains utility functions and helpers for the Flutter app:

- Utility files provide reusable functions or constants, such as web-specific utilities.
- These helpers are used throughout the app to simplify code and avoid duplication.

Refer to this directory to find or add utility functions.
