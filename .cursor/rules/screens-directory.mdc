# Screens Directory Guide

The [lib/screens/](mdc:lib/screens) directory contains all the main UI screens (pages) for the Flutter app:

- Each Dart file represents a different screen, such as home, product details, chat, user profile, login, registration, cart, and more.
- The [admin/](mdc:lib/screens/admin) subdirectory contains screens specifically for admin users, such as dashboards and moderation tools.
- Screens are typically stateful or stateless widgets that define the layout and logic for each page.

Refer to this directory to find or add new app pages.
