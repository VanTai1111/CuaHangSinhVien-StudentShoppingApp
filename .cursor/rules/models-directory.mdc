# Models Directory Guide

The [lib/models/](mdc:lib/models) directory contains data models for the Flutter app:

- Each Dart file defines a model class, such as User, Product, Category, CartItem, ChatMessage, Order, Review, and Shipper.
- Models represent the structure of data used throughout the app and are often used for serialization, deserialization, and state management.

Refer to this directory to find or add new data models.
