# Widgets Directory Guide

The [lib/widgets/](mdc:lib/widgets) directory contains reusable UI components for the Flutter app:

- Each Dart file defines a widget, such as product cards, app drawers, badges, and section layouts.
- Widgets are designed to be used across multiple screens to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication.

Refer to this directory to find or add reusable UI components.
