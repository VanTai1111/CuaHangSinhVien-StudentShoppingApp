# Services Directory Guide

The [lib/services/](mdc:lib/services) directory contains business logic and service classes for the Flutter app:

- Each Dart file defines a service, such as user, product, cart, authentication, moderation, chat, order, review, and more.
- Services handle API calls, data management, and core business logic, separating concerns from UI code.

Refer to this directory to find or add new services for app features or integrations.
