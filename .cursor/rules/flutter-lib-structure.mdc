# Flutter lib/ Directory Structure

The [lib/](mdc:lib) directory contains the main Dart code for the Flutter application:

- [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart): The entry point of the app.
- [firebase_options.dart](mdc:lib/firebase_options.dart): Firebase configuration for the app.
- [screens/](mdc:lib/screens): Contains all UI screens, including user and admin pages.
- [widgets/](mdc:lib/widgets): Reusable UI components.
- [models/](mdc:lib/models): Data models representing users, products, orders, etc.
- [services/](mdc:lib/services): Business logic, API calls, and data management.
- [utils/](mdc:lib/utils): Utility functions and helpers.

Each subdirectory is organized by feature or concern, supporting a scalable and maintainable codebase.
