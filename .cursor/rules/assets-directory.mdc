# Assets Directory Guide

The [assets/](mdc:assets) directory contains static resources for the Flutter app:

- [images/](mdc:assets/images): Contains image assets, such as [logo.png](mdc:assets/images/logo.png) and banners.
- [icons/](mdc:assets/icons): Intended for icon assets (currently empty).

Assets are referenced in the app for UI elements, branding, and visual content. Add new images or icons here and update [pubspec.yaml](mdc:pubspec.yaml) to include them.
