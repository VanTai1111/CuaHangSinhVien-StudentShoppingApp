# Backend Functions Directory Guide

The [functions/src/](mdc:functions/src) directory contains backend or serverless functions for the project:

- [productModeration.js](mdc:functions/src/productModeration.js): Implements product moderation logic and related backend functionality.

Use this directory for backend logic that supports the Flutter app, such as moderation, data processing, or integrations.
